## todo

- [x] get diff.
- [x] get commit msg from api.
- [x] make it a cli tool.
- [x] publish to cargo as a pacakge.
- [x] better error handling.
- [x] supports openai, anthropic as well.
- [x] setup cli for diff apis
- [x] github release.
- [x] binary release.
- [x] llama support.
- [ ] option to choose models for the apis

letting users choose the models will be more benificial. (set a default and let users choos.)

think from first principles and think where there can be a problem.

users should have at least friction as possible.

what will be included in the v1.1.0

- autocommit funtionality.
- llama support.
- maybe model options.
